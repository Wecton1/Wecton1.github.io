        <a>I have been playing chess since the start of the pandemic. During online school 
            I would always find myself playing chess rather than paying attention to the online 
            lectures. Chess has taught me many valuable lessons about personal accountability 
            and has also allowed me to grow mental strength. All in all, chess is a very important 
            hobby in my life and I hope everyone tries it one day.</a>
