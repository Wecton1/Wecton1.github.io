        <a>I have been playing chess since the start of the pandemic. During online school 
            I would always find myself playing chess rather than paying attention to the online 
            lectures. Chess has taught me many valuable lessons about personal accountability 
            and has also allowed me to grow mental strength. All in all, chess is a very important 
            hobby in my life and I hope everyone tries it one day.</a>

        <a>I have been playing the cello for a total of 7 years now. The cello to me has been a great 
            way to relieve stress and spend quality time by myself. I play solo gigs for consumers who 
            are looking for a cellist or another player in a quartet or triplet. I have been playing 
            for parties now for only about a year. My favorite composer for the cello has to be Bach.
            My whole life I have loved music and hope to be able to spread my love for it for as long
            as I can.
